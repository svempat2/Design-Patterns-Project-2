PURPOSE:

This is a kind of chat room program in which we will be creating a server with the port number given from the server . The user can also be logged in as the client and there can be multiple clients . the clients can input various values to the server and the server will check whether the given number is prime or not . If the given number is prime it server will store the client name and the prime number in the data structure .

I have used the hashMap as the datastructure to store the data of the user.

TO RUN:
To run as the server I am replacing the args1="server" and args2="portnumber" in the ant file .
To run as the client I am replacing the args1="client" and args2="portnumber" in the ant file .
ant -buildfile src/build.xml run

TO CLEAN:
ant -buildfile src/build.xml clean

To create tarball for submission
ant -buildfile src/build.xml tarzip
